# FixFinder

FixFinder is a local-first solution to a global problem, emphasizing and encouraging community members to take charge.

FixFinder provides a tool that diagnoses the device’s problem and finds resources for self-repair from trusted sources based on the user’s description in natural language. This allows the everyday user to find self-repair information with a click of a button, lowering the stigma and research required for determining exactly what part needs replacing.

FixFinder also offers a community marketplace, where users can get their phone fixed by certified repairers in their local community. These freelancers charge less than official repair shops. If the user decides that they no longer want their phone, they can sell it to repair shops, benefiting the local community and allowing the repair shop to reuse the parts more effectively.
